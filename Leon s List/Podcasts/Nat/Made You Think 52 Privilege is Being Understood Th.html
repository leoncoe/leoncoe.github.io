class="">00:27 – This is one of our occasional article episodes where we have found an article so interesting and profound that it warrants an episode. This article is bordering on us on a short book. Very fun to read. The article is The Tower from a blog called Hotel Concierge. We don&#x27;t know who this writer is but he/she/they are amazing.</p><p id="a28d6db7-eb3f-4806-849f-8ac07b1479a1" class="">03:59 – The Tower is based on the Tower of Babel which is built to be closer to God and to unite humanity in one place, under one language. This is destroyed by God and humanity is spread across the world. The analogy is that that with modern communication, being able to talk instantly with everyone it is creating this Tower of Babel like effect, leading to outrage culture.</p><p id="edf58c68-31dc-415b-9838-0787bb26a609" class="">05:48 – Our need to be understood and to feel in control is fuelling that outrage and rebellion. Previously unprivileged groups are now succeeding in the dominance hierarchy. We all need a set of beliefs and having any beliefs are better than none. If you have no beliefs, then you just sort of become a vessel for other people’s ideas.</p><p id="f7ed7844-939c-4f21-a63b-95730a612f06" class="">07:44 – There is always a tendency towards more chaos. Art in all forms is an attempt to be understood. Privilege as how easily your art and memes can be understood. Multiculturalism and diversity go counter towards the goal of assimilation. A lot of white liberals who were fighting for diversity don&#x27;t actually want diversity. They don&#x27;t want different cultures. They want the same culture in different colors.</p><p id="4f71001f-6fed-4b86-b969-8dfef31a6d81" class="">10:21 – This is a well-written persuasive article.</p><p id="3096b204-eaf8-4b8d-9475-53e3f7325d34" class="">“The Judeo-Christian capital G—o—d, robed, bearded, opinionated, deadlifts, thematically male, is the avatar of civilization, just check the year. Even so, His omnipotence is not uncontested. He knows this. You should see what He did to the guys with the golden calf. God said, “Let there will be light,” and there was light. But just as Nyx preceded Zeus, that means the darkness was already there. And the house always wins at the second law of thermodynamics.”</p><p id="d7c74203-7457-4cd9-bde4-0d83e34ddd61" class="">The writing style comes off as masculine. Even before God created light, there was still was darkness. Tendency back to the chaos of darkness. You have to deliberately fight against chaos.
