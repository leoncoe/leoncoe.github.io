</p><p id="d7e62b92-244c-4749-80f0-39f3162a95a1" class=""><strong>I.</strong></p><p id="86bb9148-4028-4e4f-af0f-d6f2efe2ddcd" class="">In Chesterton’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Father-Brown-ebook/dp/B003XYE7YU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=as_li_tl&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=80cee7fc381622e3e77edf8f12fdb13d"><em>The Secret of Father Brown</em></a>, a beloved nobleman who murdered his good-for-nothing brother in a duel thirty years ago returns to his hometown wracked by guilt. All the townspeople want to forgive him immediately, and they mock the titular priest for only being willing to give a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection. They lecture the priest on the virtues of charity and compassion.</p><p id="c4223359-24ed-401e-9670-6084f743f685" class="">Later, it comes out that the beloved nobleman did <em>not</em> in fact kill his good-for-nothing brother. The good-for-nothing brother killed the beloved nobleman (and stole his identity). <em>Now</em> the townspeople want to see him lynched or burned alive, and it is only the priest who – consistently – offers a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection.</p><p id="789be8d8-b278-46f6-8446-9245e59f2f4b" class="">The priest tells them:</p><blockquote id="c900edef-a7ba-4489-b850-be88bf8144ba" class="">It seems to me that you only pardon the sins that you don’t really think sinful. You only forgive criminals when they commit what you don’t regard as crimes, but rather as conventions. You forgive a conventional duel just as you forgive a conventional divorce. You forgive because there isn’t anything to be forgiven.</blockquote><p id="59ba352e-22ad-4272-8c98-2bd18b2c39a6" class="">He further notes that this is why the townspeople can self-righteously consider themselves more compassionate and forgiving than he is. Actual forgiveness, the kind the priest needs to cultivate to forgive evildoers, is really really hard. The fake forgiveness the townspeople use to forgive the people they like is really easy, so they get to boast not only of their forgiving nature, but of how much nicer they are than those mean old priests who find forgiveness difficult and want penance along with it.</p><p id="94b107c6-664e-4f5a-b9ad-2223ffdaa003" class="">After some thought I agree with Chesterton’s point. There are a lot of people who say “I forgive you” when they mean “No harm done”, and a lot of people who say “That was unforgiveable” when they mean “That was genuinely really bad”. Whether or not forgiveness is <em>right</em> is a complicated topic I do not want to get in here. But since forgiveness is generally considered a virtue, and one that many want credit for having, I think it’s fair to say you only earn the right to call yourself ‘forgiving’ if you forgive things that genuinely hurt you.</p><p id="cabc5030-0f18-4e94-96a3-23c8e5e27d4e" class="">To borrow Chesterton’s example, if you think divorce is a-ok, then you don’t get to “forgive” people their divorces, you merely ignore them. Someone who thinks divorce is abhorrent can “forgive” divorce. <em>You</em> can forgive theft, or murder, or tax evasion, or something <em>you</em> find abhorrent.</p><p id="2a2e2b01-7e37-4733-93e9-bf0125e6dc29" class="">I mean, from a utilitarian point of view, you are still doing the correct action of not giving people grief because they’re a divorcee. You can have all the Utility Points you want. All I’m saying is that if you “forgive” something you don’t care about, you don’t earn any Virtue Points.</p><p id="22be04ca-05a8-47d4-9e4f-320d95aa0210" class="">(by way of illustration: a billionaire who gives $100 to charity gets as many Utility Points as an impoverished pensioner who donates the same amount, but the latter gets a lot more Virtue Points)</p><p id="4132b81c-36f3-4df4-8bbe-80be43dab61d" class="">Tolerance is also considered a virtue, but it suffers the same sort of dimished expectations forgiveness does.</p><p id="58615208-b8b1-4bfd-a475-97fe2acab162" class="">The Emperor <a href="http://poetrychina.net/Story_of_Zen/zenstory3a.htm">summons before him</a> Bodhidharma and asks: “Master, I have been tolerant of innumerable gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, transgender people, and Jews. How many Virtue Points have I earned for my meritorious deeds?”</p><p id="8927183e-a825-4cdc-99a4-531da43b943e" class="">Bodhidharma answers: “None at all”.</p><p id="a10d43e3-06bd-4080-9da5-4cc531390e9d" class="">The Emperor, somewhat put out, demands to know why.</p><p id="7d8b289c-3e3f-4bd6-aaff-8de2b0876351" class="">Bodhidharma asks: “Well, what do you think of gay people?”</p><p id="e2f18934-7d97-4e43-8744-3ae8f932683a" class="">The Emperor answers: “What do you think I am, some kind of homophobic bigot? Of course I have nothing against gay people!”</p><p id="fe57b09c-5d6f-420b-8cab-0ab55cc91687" class="">And Bodhidharma answers: “Thus do you gain no merit by tolerating them!”</p><p id="78d1799f-034a-4742-951f-0f4a5e1c1259" class=""><strong>II.</strong></p><p id="198c2e16-f7e4-4647-ac1f-817ed16235a8" class="">If I had to define “tolerance” it would be something like “respect and kindness toward members of an outgroup”.</p><p id="eb3706b4-1e68-4f62-9897-715e390c6d84" class="">And today we have an almost unprecedented situation.</p><p id="0fb0a801-47af-40d9-b4e8-ce8fa2c26af6" class="">We have a lot of people – like the Emperor – boasting of being able to tolerate everyone from every outgroup they can imagine, loving the outgroup, writing long paeans to how great the outgroup is, staying up at night fretting that somebody else might not like the outgroup enough.</p><p id="42f1cc44-951c-4909-8208-dd179518e5f5" class="">This is really surprising. It’s a total reversal of everything we know about human psychology up to this point. No one did any genetic engineering. No one passed out weird glowing pills in the public schools. And yet suddenly we get an entire group of people who conspicuously promote and defend their outgroups, the outer the better.</p><p id="89a19e0a-a58f-4257-90fd-f38521174016" class="">What is going on here?</p><p id="d5b88b5a-077d-4415-b0c8-a31e98fb24d8" class="">Let’s start by asking what exactly an outgroup is.</p><p id="d19d2684-d635-453c-bcaa-44fb2ce680c3" class="">There’s a very boring sense in which, assuming the Emperor’s straight, gays are part of his “outgroup” ie a group that he is not a member of. But if the Emperor has curly hair, are straight-haired people part of his outgroup?

I don’t think that’s quite right.</p><p id="2be4facb-61a6-46c1-aa92-b8e578157f34" class="">Compare the Nazis to the German Jews and to the Japanese. The Nazis were very similar to the German Jews: they looked the same, spoke the same language, came from a similar culture. The Nazis were totally different from the Japanese: different race, different language, vast cultural gap. But the Nazis and Japanese mostly got along pretty well. Heck, the Nazis were actually moderately positively disposed to the <em>Chinese</em>, even when they were technically at war. Meanwhile, the conflict between the Nazis and the German Jews – some of whom didn’t even realize they were anything other than German until they checked their grandparents’ birth certificate – is the stuff of history and nightmares. Any theory of outgroupishness that naively assumes the Nazis’ natural outgroup is Japanese or Chinese people will be totally inadequate.</p><p id="7d8468cf-4c9e-4fb9-8ccf-47a25eb24929" class="">And this isn’t a weird exception. Freud spoke of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences">the narcissism of small differences</a>, saying that “it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other”.

Anyone in the former Yugoslavia and anyone else in the former Yugoslavia.</p><p id="67b3842f-adf0-4b0d-be7c-cdafeb7f9c86" class="">So what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don’t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic.

The answer with Germans and Japanese is obvious – a strategic alliance.

There are very many claims and counterclaims about the precise meaning of this, but it ended up being a big part of the evidence in favor of the current consensus that all white people are at least a little racist.</p><p id="5ab7e6ab-30aa-40e7-9eaa-8ffd841786e1" class="">Anyway, three months ago, someone finally had the bright idea of <a href="http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2014/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf">doing an Implicit Association Test with political parties</a>, and they found that people’s unconscious partisan biases were <em>half again as strong</em> as their unconscious racial biases (h/t <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism">Bloomberg</a>. For example, if you are a white Democrat, your unconscious bias against blacks (as measured by something called a d-score) is 0.16, but your unconscious bias against Republicans will be 0.23. The Cohen’s <em>d</em> for racial bias was 0.61, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#.22Small.22.2C_.22medium.22.2C_.22large.22_effect_sizes">the book</a> a “moderate” effect size; for party it was 0.95, a “large” effect size.</p><p id="d82fe4d8-ff00-4bd4-8f67-fecdaebea961" class="">Okay, fine, but we know race has <em>real world</em> consequences. Like, there have been <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/">several studies</a> where people sent out a bunch of identical resumes except sometimes with a black person’s photo and other times with a white person’s photo, and it was noticed that employers were much more likely to invite the fictional white candidates for interviews. So just some stupid Implicit Association Test results can’t compare to that, right?</p><p id="0300461c-76c0-4bf3-b250-eeb48bcedeb2" class="">Iyengar and Westwood also decided to do the resume test for parties. They asked subjects to decide which of several candidates should get a scholarship (subjects were told this was a genuine decision for the university the researchers were affiliated with). Some resumes had photos of black people, others of white people.

People have been studying “belief congruence theory” – the idea that differences in beliefs are more important than demographic factors in forming in-groups and outgroups – for decades. As early as 1967, Smith et al were doing surveys all over the country and <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=2005-11098-001">finding that</a> people were more likely to accept friendships across racial lines than across beliefs; in the forty years since then, the observation has been replicated scores of times. Insko, Moe, and Nacoste’s 2006 review <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420130206/abstract">Belief Congruence And Racial Discrimination</a> concludes that:</p><blockquote id="41c574d4-c478-4aeb-b0dd-f179c16b14fc" class="">. The literature was judged supportive of a weak version of belief congruence theory which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent or ineffective, belief is more important than race as a determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination. Evidence for a strong version of belief congruence theory (which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent, or ineffective, belief is the only determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination) and was judged much more problematic.</blockquote><p id="12a0336d-aaa1-40f1-9007-f0e53ccb12f1" class="">One of the best-known examples of racism is the “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner” scenario where parents are scandalized about their child marrying someone of a different race. Pew has done <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/">some good work on this</a> and found that only 23% of conservatives and 1% (!) of liberals admit they would be upset in this situation.

This seems contrary to what we know about social psychology. What’s up?</p><p id="a3cc973b-e89d-42d0-85f6-ecf96f37f186" class="">We noted that outgroups are rarely literally “the group most different from you”, and in fact far more likely to be groups very similar to you sharing <em>almost</em> all your characteristics and living in the same area.</p><p id="fb9eea5e-c65e-4e56-9a22-faf36f6519db" class="">We then noted that although liberals and conservatives live in the same area, they might as well be two totally different countries or universe as far as level of interaction were concerned.</p><p id="2eb2a9b0-b0c2-41e1-a0c7-d7da5b829cda" class="">Contra the usual idea of them being marked only by voting behavior, we described them as very different tribes with totally different cultures. You can speak of “American culture” only in the same way you can speak of “Asian culture” – that is, with a lot of interior boundaries being pushed under the rug.</p><p id="48f71444-72da-4edc-8f72-441856b598c3" class="">The outgroup of the Red Tribe is occasionally blacks and gays and Muslims, more often the Blue Tribe.</p><p id="87cb4906-10d2-4fbc-a746-82ce2d8430d8" class="">The Blue Tribe has performed some kind of very impressive act of alchemy, and transmuted <em>all</em> of its outgroup hatred to the Red Tribe.</p><p id="05ccb8fb-e275-4528-8789-5fe873928f04" class="">This is not surprising.

Once the Blue Tribe was able to enlist the blacks and gays and Muslims in their ranks, they became allies of convenience who deserve to be rehabilitated with mildly condescending paeans to their virtue. “There never was a coward where the shamrock grows.”</p><p id="b8d17f7b-0a00-479b-9e17-8399142e1161" class="">Spending your entire life insulting the other tribe and talking about how terrible they are makes you look, well, tribalistic. It is definitely not high class. So when members of the Blue Tribe decide to dedicate their entire life to yelling about how terrible the Red Tribe is, they make sure that instead of saying “the Red Tribe”, they say “America”, or “white people”, or “straight white men”. That way it’s <em>humble self-criticism</em>. They are <em>so</em> interested in justice that they are willing to critique <em>their own beloved side</em>, much as it pains them to do so. We know they are not exaggerating, because one might exaggerate the flaws of an enemy, but that anyone would exaggerate their <em>own</em> flaws fails <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment">the criterion of embarrassment</a>.</p><p id="1737eb9c-be7d-4c76-851f-4eda0d4cc705" class="">The Blue Tribe always has an excuse at hand to persecute and crush any Red Tribers unfortunate enough to fall into its light-matter-universe by defining them as all-powerful domineering oppressors. They appeal to the fact that this is definitely the way it works in the Red Tribe’s dark-matter-universe, and that’s in the same country so it has to be the same community for all intents and purposes. As a result, every Blue Tribe institution is permanently licensed to take whatever emergency measures are necessary against the Red Tribe, however disturbing they might otherwise seem.</p><p id="b8ee5be0-8153-41ec-ab29-1daec90cd4e4" class="">And so how virtuous, how noble the Blue Tribe! Perfectly tolerant of all of the different groups that just so happen to be allied with them, never intolerant unless it happen to be against intolerance itself. Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that awful Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing their own culture and striving to make it better!</p><p id="ad0aadc5-46b2-4add-8726-b7793d847495" class="">Sorry. But I hope this is at least a <em>little</em> convincing. The weird dynamic of outgroup-philia and ingroup-phobia isn’t anything of the sort. It’s just good old-fashioned in-group-favoritism and outgroup bashing, a little more sophisticated and a little more sneaky.</p><p id="64f4390a-3144-4f04-adb9-05c01828d51c" class=""><strong>XI.</strong></p><p id="63e33004-84f1-43ac-83fd-16fe4b1f868d" class="">This essay is bad and I should feel bad.</p><p id="ea84e6b6-ac98-4bea-867c-b9afd3693ea4" class="">I should feel bad because I made <em>exactly</em> the mistake I am trying to warn everyone else about, and it wasn’t until I was almost done that I noticed.</p><p id="c54ce809-c702-42a5-8d3f-4ebaf635b3ae" class="">How virtuous, how noble I must be!

Once I’ve written a ten thousand word essay savagely attacking the Blue Tribe, either I’m a very special person or they’re my outgroup. And I’m not <em>that</em> special.</p><p id="d08ba874-434a-4b96-a1fd-319791f33956" class="">Just as you can pull a fast one and look humbly self-critical if you make your audience assume there’s just one American culture, so maybe you can trick people by assuming there’s only one Blue Tribe.</p><p id="06d43fa2-aa44-497c-b77b-427de7a5104b" class="">I’m pretty sure I’m not Red, but I did talk about the Grey Tribe above, and I show all the risk factors for being one of them. That means that, although my critique of the Blue Tribe may be right or wrong, in terms of <em>motivation</em> it comes from the same place as a Red Tribe member talking about how much they hate al-Qaeda or a Blue Tribe member talking about how much they hate ignorant bigots. And when I boast of being able to tolerate Christians and Southerners whom the Blue Tribe is mean to, I’m not being tolerant at all, just noticing people so far away from me they wouldn’t make a good outgroup anyway.</p><p id="4f4a18e6-bbac-434d-b6e9-f8ea75dad273" class="">I had <em>fun</em> writing this article. People do not have fun writing articles savagely criticizing their in-group. People can criticize their in-group, it’s not <em>humanly impossible</em>, but it takes nerves of steel, it makes your blood boil, you should sweat blood. It shouldn’t be <em>fun</em>.</p><p id="f014f160-761b-490c-99c1-331460128cc3" class="">You can bet some white guy on Gawker who week after week churns out “Why White People Are So Terrible” and “Here’s What Dumb White People Don’t Understand” is having fun and not sweating any blood at all. He’s not criticizing his in-group, he’s never even <em>considered</em> criticizing his in-group. I can’t blame him. Criticizing the in-group is a really difficult project I’ve barely begun to build the mental skills necessary to even consider.</p><p id="a241f879-4150-474a-b8a4-87c6382db8f6" class="">I can think of criticisms of my own tribe. Important criticisms, true ones. But the thought of writing them makes my blood boil.</p><p id="66ff203c-27ad-4848-ad32-959ccf178162" class="">I imagine might I feel like some liberal US Muslim leader, when he goes on the O’Reilly Show, and O’Reilly ambushes him and demands to know why he and other American Muslims haven’t condemned beheadings by ISIS more, demands that he criticize them right there on live TV. And you can see the wheels in the Muslim leader’s head turning, thinking something like “Okay, obviously beheadings are terrible and I hate them as much as anyone. But you don’t care even <em>the slightest bit</em> about the victims of beheadings. You’re just looking for a way to score points against me so you can embarass all Muslims. And I would rather personally behead every single person in the world than give a smug bigot like you a single microgram more stupid self-satisfaction than you’ve already got.”</p><p id="fa0b42f3-c64e-478c-918f-1d8a8d8aa324" class="">That is how I feel when asked to criticize my own tribe, even for correct reasons. If you think you’re criticizing your own tribe, and your blood is not at that temperature, consider the possibility that you aren’t.</p><p id="605703ff-107d-480c-95d1-36d4d62ddea2" class="">But if I want Self-Criticism Virtue Points, criticizing the Grey Tribe is the only honest way to get them. And if I want Tolerance Points, my own personal cross to bear right now is tolerating the Blue Tribe. I need to remind myself that when they are bad people, they are merely Osama-level bad people instead of Thatcher-level bad people. And when they are good people, they are powerful and necessary crusaders against the evils of the world.</p><p id="d9b9fd47-8b35-49a6-8a79-b8a8166a5d2d" class="">The worst thing that could happen to this post is to have it be used as convenient feces to fling at the Blue Tribe whenever feces are necessary. Which, given what has happened to my last couple of posts along these lines and the obvious biases of my own subconscious, I already expect it will be.</p><p id="a246ca41-abad-4966-a0d2-c2b4d3a0fe74" class="">But the best thing that could happen to this post is that it makes a lot of people, especially myself, figure out how to be more tolerant. Not in the “of course I’m tolerant, why shouldn’t I be?” sense of the Emperor in Part I. But in the sense of “being tolerant makes me see red, makes me sweat blood, but darn it <em>I am going to be tolerant anyway</em>.”</p></div></article></body></html>
