</p><p id="59f4f0cb-ab4d-4627-b37f-278a21df39b4" class="">It’s 2013, and I’m lounging on the hardwood floor of my childhood bedroom with a blasphemous book that I smuggled home from college: Sam Harris’ <em>Letter to a Christian Nation.</em> I devour the whole thing in a single sitting. It feels like Harris is letting me in on a giant secret, a Big Truth that my very Christian upbringing had kept hidden from me. God is dead, he says. We killed him a few hundred years ago and replaced him with a sophisticated scientific understanding of life, the universe, and everything.</p><p id="b9d9136e-f025-46c9-b386-01ed45467c64" class=""><strong>Fast-forward six years, and I’ve started to realize that the God vs. science situation is a bit more complicated than Sam Harris led me to believe. The more I learn, the more I suspect that rationalists only managed to kill a very narrow and anthropomorphic conception of God.</strong> People who study complex systems started <strong>using new words to talk about god-like phenomena — metaphors that are more palatable to secular minds. </strong>I believe these new words can help scientifically-minded people better understand what it <em>actually</em> felt like to believe in God before science became a Thing. Let’s take a tour through the pantheon of 2019 and explore what these seven “gods” might teach us in our era of ecological crisis and <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">post-truth confusion</a>.</p><h2 id="2c40a87d-ee69-4158-90fc-c9111c399e35" class="">Human Colossus</h2><p id="0217d4f2-cc76-4bf2-91b9-a3e275d8f987" class=""><em>The god of collective human knowledge</em></p><figure id="e6dc6196-5d6d-49f8-9dca-d7b554376e1a" class="image"><a href="Metaphors we believe by the pantheon of 2019/human-colossus.png"><img style="width:700px" src="Metaphors we believe by the pantheon of 2019/human-colossus.png"/></a></figure><p id="7467d46a-eddb-4b77-af48-8ec515aeb7f1" class="">First up in our tour of the 2019 pantheon: the Human Colossus. This god was <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">named by the blog Wait But Why</a>, and it helps us imagine all 8 billion humans as a single super-organism. It’s inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes">Colossus of Rhodes</a> — an ancient Greek statue of the sun-god Helios. Standing 108 ft. tall, the statue was built to celebrate a victory in battle and later served as a model for the French designers of the Statue of Liberty. Wait But Why re-imagines the Colossus as a giant person sitting on top of a giant computer. Each one of us is like a little cell in this “body” that we can’t quite see from the outside.</p><p id="9790c8d6-cae1-4a63-a5a0-f0f62435588e" class="">In the past, humans lived in small isolated tribes that were spread out all across the planet. Traders and explorers often journeyed to faraway lands, but cultural cross-pollination was limited by the speed of their transportation technology. We’ve spent the last few hundred years building communication infrastructure that connects billions of people together: ships, trains, telegraphs, phones, radio, television, internet. Now we live in a globalized economy where instantaneous information transfer is the new normal. <strong>We’ve summoned the Human Colossus with our reverence for media tech, financial profits, and knowledge accumulation, and it’s growing faster every year. </strong>Here’s how Tim Urban explains this colossal phenomenon:</p><blockquote id="1f455283-1469-4434-b05c-083918794e0b" class="">The better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity’s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or muscle fiber in its body … The Human Colossus began inventing things that no human could have dreamed of inventing on their own — things that would have seemed like absurd science fiction to people only a few generations before. If an individual’s core motivation is to pass its genes on, which keeps the species going, the forces of macroeconomics make the Human Colossus’s core motivation to create value, which means it tends to want to invent newer and better technology. Every time it does that, it becomes an even better inventor, which means it can invent new stuff faster.</blockquote><p id="5aa1e614-27ca-41aa-95e9-ae4e386995c7" class="">To paraphrase Mark Zuckerberg, this god is a product of our long-running effort to make the world “more open and connected.” The Human Colossus has brought us many amazing innovations with its sprawling server farms and network infrastructure. It’s also brought us to the brink of ecological collapse by exploiting Earth’s natural resources. TBD whether we will regret calling it into existence.</p><figure id="3f92a464-7c86-452c-876a-6933accb9252" class="image"><a href="Metaphors we believe by the pantheon of 2019/twitter.gif"><img style="width:660px" src="Metaphors we believe by the pantheon of 2019/twitter.gif"/></a></figure><p id="1d5961a3-c6ea-4b3b-8f11-219946bb32a2" class="">Twenty-four hours of global Twitter activity.

He’s appeared in religious texts and English literature throughout the ages, including John Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em> (1667) and Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” (1955). Most recently, he was brought back to life by the blog Slate Star Codex. In an internet-famous essay called <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations on Moloch</a>, SSC warns us that this god is behind humans’ failure to coordinate at scale. He points to a wide variety of intractable problems — climate change, the prisoner’s dilemma, overfishing, arms races, government corruption — and explains the underlying pattern they all have in common:</p><blockquote id="4695c5e4-13bb-4994-8355-67f8b004efa6" class="">The implicit question is: if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”. It’s powerful not because it’s correct — nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything — but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn’t an agent … In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before.

Small agricultural villages were transformed into the largest urban center in the world, complete with a bureaucracy, military, and class system.

The doing of the thing is plugged into a much larger worldview which explains both how to do the thing and why you do the thing — James Scott calls that metis. </strong>When a larger unit (states, corporations, what have you) subsumes the smaller unit, it tends to uproot metis for efficiency, for raw gain, for humanitarian purposes, etc. Power is weighted heavily in favor of the larger unit, not least because community explanations appear irrational or are otherwise unintelligible. To regain some of that power, communities or groups within them tend to form mass movements. Those then replicate the ill effects of the original larger unit, whether they gain power or not. For various reasons, mass movements tend to sap power from their adherents and frustrate them more. They also tend to prescribe epistemic solutions. <strong>In other words, the origin and response tend to exacerbate and blur into one another.</strong></blockquote><p id="532c6e63-4e55-4f6e-a63c-572e11ed04d9" class="">A prototypical example of The Uruk Machine is the story of what happened when the first European settlers tried to make deals with indigenous people.

In the 21st century, we’re very accustomed to 2D maps that show Earth’s territory divided into a jigsaw puzzle of sovereign countries. But these maps have become terribly outdated in an age when global tech platforms are <em>also</em> major political actors on the world stage. The Stack is an attempt to re-present what systems of power actually look like in the modern era. And it’s what you get when a systems thinker tries to create a system to rule all systems — a 3D “megastructure” made up of six layers: earth, cloud, city, address, interface, user. Here’s how MIT Press describes the theory:</p><blockquote id="11174825-86ad-43a1-9da5-b04ee8eb4398" class="">Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation—smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation—can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us.</blockquote><p id="46c36fb2-c7f8-4783-b8e9-00dcea17bd39" class="">Unlike the Human Colossus, The Stack is a theory of governance that explores how our political systems might co-evolve with technology in the near future. Whereas the other gods are not subject to our will, Bratton believes that we’ll eventually be able to control The Stack. <strong>He claims it’s a neutral description of our world, but I suspect it’s deeply ideological. </strong>Bratton says our obsession with subjective human experience has kept us from embracing our evolutionary destiny: fusing our organic bodies with the technological Stack. He hopes we’ll eventually give up on what he calls the myth of human exceptionalism and create a “more reality-based understanding of ourselves.” The Stack is ultimately a technocrat’s dream: a high-fidelity model of the world that’s meant to help theorists and practitioners completely re-design it.</p><p id="6e4d12bf-e0c5-4b78-9962-6d798b5babb6" class=""><strong>If history is a guide, it’s hard for me to believe that such an abstract image of god will have a long shelf life.

According to the <em>Poetic Edda</em> — a 13th century collection of Icelandic poems — Yggdrasil is a giant holy ash tree with branches that extend all over the cosmos. Venkatesh’s modern rendition of the myth helps us understand that, in our globalized economy, even small local actions have strange and unpredictable ripple effects.

Everything is internal. Nothing can be turned into somebody else’s problem or some other species’ problem. Our actions boomerang back to haunt us or help us, like the plastic waste that floats inside the fish we eat or the friendly reply to a Twitter thread that turns into a beautiful life-long collaboration. It’s always surprised me that we chose to use the “cloud” as a metaphor for the internet rather than a tree. Like the trees in a forest, there’s a sprawling and invisible root system that’s just beneath our feet. Yggdrasil absorbs our data from the server farms at its roots so that we might be able to enjoy its fruits. Technologists, in particular, now make structural decisions that impact the lives of billions of people all over the world.

To say that an “imaginary” entity, existing only in human minds, has agency, is not much stranger than suggesting that humans themselves, inscrutable piles of preferences that we are, have agency. Agency is no more than a “quick and dirty way of contextualizing the temporal activities of entropy climbers,” as St. Rev puts it.</blockquote><p id="f9ad59e8-726c-4fac-982c-930121bb9979" class="">While the other gods we’ve explored in this post are all-encompassing, the egregore concept makes room for a plurality of gods. There are as many egregores as there are groups of people. From small cliques to large corporations, egregores come in all shapes and sizes. They interact with one another via human “representatives”, each of whom embody and enact the interests of the egregores they are a part of.</p><p id="cc020f0d-b850-4d56-bad5-94a2e9cc550a" class="">Historically, the most successful egregores have developed a symbiotic relationship with their human hosts. By way of example, Sarah Perry points to the ritualized days of rest found in many organized religions: “Old entities often have a sabbath attached to them, a frequent, repeating time for rest. The sacralization of this time places a hard-to-erode boundary around the demands that can be placed on constituent humans. This may be a way of keeping ‘demands’ within the productive zone, and not triggering the entity’s own demise by demanding too much.”</p><p id="7114d143-bec8-42ec-a077-4569ff4c036b" class="">Unlike ancient deities, however, modern egregores are able to demand more time and energy from their human hosts now that the Uruk Machine has knocked out local social protections like the sabbath. And thanks to Yggdrasil, today’s egregores can spread more quickly because they aren’t limited by geography or transportation technology.

During this period in the Christian West, a person’s identity was determined by God. To say this is to take no stand on whether there actually was a God in the Middle Ages. The classic metaphysical arguments for the existence of God are irrelevant here. What matters instead is that in the Middle Ages, people could not help but experience themselves as determined or created by God … This order of things was not a belief that anyone argued for or a worldview that anyone proposed; it was simply taken for granted by everyone worth talking or listening to. The way of life of a culture is not an explicit set of beliefs held by the people living in it.

We’re hosts to increasingly parasitic Egregores.</strong></p><p id="d905066b-d8fe-4781-ba53-b4b43a89a82c" class=""><mark class="highlight-yellow_background"><strong>There’s a tight feedback loop between the gods we believe in and the societies we create, which is why we must take seriously the metaphors we believe by.</strong></mark></p><p id="6eded660-346a-4aa5-af16-45b267bd09f1" class="">We shouldn’t feel helpless in the face of the 2019 pantheon. In fact, the new “gods” <em>ought</em> to give us a bit of hope — they’ve helped us re-discover the old, paradoxical idea that complex systems are simultaneously inside of us and bigger than us. They’re the product of our stories, our drives, our aspirations, our love. With that in mind, I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1142115581572866050?s=20">frustrated</a> by how much time and energy we waste pretending that we can escape from the systems we’re embedded in. We act like talking heads even in private spaces, trading our personal stories for the hand-me-down hot takes of PR strategists on high. We fall into conversational ruts, we become <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2014/06/01/solved-conversations/">predictable</a>. And the collective egregore mind gets hollowed out by abstract pundit speak that’s untethered from down-to-earth experiences. We have to supply the mind, or the mind falls apart.</p><p id="d0e31520-6ac3-4227-81d1-9d0035789008" class="">I’ve lived inside many bubbles of belief in my 25 short years: Evangelical Christian, hardcore rationalist, techno-utopian. Each time I escaped, I thought I’d finally come to a more accurate understanding of how things <em>really</em> are. Now that I’ve acquainted myself with the pantheon of 2019, I’m feeling ready to leave behind the idea that it’s possible to get a god’s eye view of my world. As Tim Morton says in his book <a href="https://www.notion.so/Being-Ecological-c7a732d9d06d46b29d3a905393907c10"><em>Being Ecological</em></a>:</p><blockquote id="15f76e2c-fd04-48c5-8db6-5cf1d99c02be" class=""><strong>How I interpret data will depend on what I think I want to find. How I see myself depends on the kind of person I am. How I interpret things is entangled with prefabricated concepts about what interpreting means. </strong>This gives rise to a strange insight, which is that living in a scientific age doesn’t mean you are living in a cold world of objectivity. It means you realize that you can’t achieve escape velocity from your own embeddedness in data interpretation or confirmation bias. We cannot get out.</blockquote><p id="73493a57-5614-497b-9304-a76e66bb7b17" class="">The process of popping out of bubbles and discovering new ones is a never-ending story. This realization definitely won’t quell my curiosity, but I will move forward with a bit more humility and plenty of deep breaths.</p><p id="e7bc79c0-07e4-4985-9152-1f95408e6763" class=""><em>Got questions or comments or criticisms?
