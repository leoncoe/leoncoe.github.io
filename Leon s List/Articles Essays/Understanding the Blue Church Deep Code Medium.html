Not the tired old Christian cliches they defeated back in the ’60s, but a new faith based on cultural identity and outright rejection of the Blue Faith.” — /u/notjfao</blockquote><p id="2d99f004-bca1-4178-9183-1e53c9618648" class="">A number of folks noted that they were not familiar with the concept of the Blue Church and wondered what was meant by it. The Democratic Party? Liberalism? Progressivism? As I mentioned in SA:2017, I had originally lifted the idea wholesale from that Reddit post with only an intuitive sense that it (and its juxtaposition with a Red <em>Religion)</em> was useful and pointed at something real.</p><p id="65fafee6-57a5-4d8c-b5c9-c04d9d070698" class="">In this essay, I dive into the concept. Below I endeavor to provide an answer that is adequate to Deep Code. I believe that the results are well worth the effort, but this is not a simple journey. Few things of importance these days are. If we want to get to the bottom of the contemporary situation, we are going to have to get comfortable going deep.</p><p id="d9a4aa65-db29-454f-a7bc-9bc2494bdbec" class=""><strong>The abstract is this: the Blue Church is a kind of narrative / ideology control structure that is a natural result of mass media.</strong> It is an evolved (rather than designed) function that has come over the past half-century to be <strong>deeply connected with the Democratic political “Establishment” and lightly connected with the “Deep State” to form an effective political and </strong><strong><em>dominant</em></strong><strong> cultural force in the United States.</strong></p><p id="5c1a6532-f3f6-4305-b25a-6503f0606048" class="">We can trace its roots at least as far back as the beginning of the 20th Century where it emerged in response to the new capabilities of mass media for social control. By mid-century it began to play an increasingly meaningful role in forming and shaping American culture-producing institutions; became pervasive through the last half of the 20th and seems to have peaked in its influence somewhere in the first decade of the 21st Century.</p><p id="ddf42680-72de-4b23-8fcb-996fc20bc6b1" class=""><strong>It is now beginning to unravel.</strong></p><p id="f3d55180-a385-47ed-9d05-06c7745bc34e" class="">In part it is unravelling because of developing schisms within its master narrative, the Blue <em>Faith</em>. These are important, but they are not the subject of this essay. In this essay, I am focusing on what I think is both much more fundamental and much less obvious: deep shifts in technology and society that are undermining the very foundations of the Church. Shifts that render the Church <em>itself</em> obsolete.</p><p id="0a9b7b36-89d7-420b-911f-7e97c8682014" class="">If you are ready for a deep dive, come on in.

For those who want to go deeper, I recommend the whole book. The basic idea is actually pretty simple.</p><p id="85bbcd31-abcc-4520-871b-3af9ac8d565f" class="">Imagine a boat. We are going to row that boat, starting with but one paddle. If you’ve ever learned to canoe, you know that this isn’t simple. There is an art to it. You have to hold the paddle correctly, you have to learn how to put it into the water, how to stroke, how to return. The difference between doing it well and doing it poorly is significant. But, with a little practice, almost everyone can get at least reasonably capable of rowing their canoe.</p><p id="3c901da2-2ce8-4289-8ee3-a15e584201f7" class="">This is a “management of complexity” problem. The relationship between oar, water, boat and person is complex. All of these systems are feeding back on each other in subtle and hard to predict ways. But the “control capacity” of a standard-issue human is up to the task. The human body, adapted to things like walking upright on two legs and throwing rocks has enough control capacity to manage this level of complexity.</p><p id="0617a94e-3330-4c55-b0cd-a80e2531d9f1" class="">Now add another oar. Generally, even someone experienced with a single paddle takes a little while to get it figured out. In particular, you have to learn how to simplify the problem by constraining some of the degrees of freedom of the paddles. Perhaps you fix the oars to the boat so that they can only traverse a single path. Certainly, you are going to have to make sure that you are paddling both oars in the same rhythm. By getting the oars into “coherence,” you can get the complexity of the problem inside your control capacity.</p><p id="f5c91a71-8199-4e4c-ae0b-853b805f630f" class=""><strong>Coherence is one of the most important concepts in the management of complexity. When you take two systems (two paddles) and synchronize them, you radically simplify the complexity of the overall system. By getting two paddles into coherence, you are able to turn two paddles that you can’t manage into one big paddle that you can manage.</strong></p><p id="3bac55c7-54b8-436b-936f-9ed1f1816d33" class="">Now add another person to the mix. Side by side — each with one oar. This kicks the complexity up a lot. We are now dealing not only with two oars, we are dealing with two different control structures. And, of course, the only way to get things moving is for the control structures to get into coherence. Fortunately, humans are pretty good at this too. Like dancers or musicians playing together, we have a lot of bandwidth for small group synchrony.

This is a radical simplification. As the Greeks and Romans of old discovered, it scales.

More on that in the next post perhaps.</p><figure id="0e827d40-126a-4d34-9649-ee3e2f12548b" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IPF3hkaPZCjpQtZaPFmITQ.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IPF3hkaPZCjpQtZaPFmITQ.jpeg?q=20"/></a></figure><figure id="c7924c6f-bbb2-4171-88ca-f4a5d77129eb" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*IPF3hkaPZCjpQtZaPFmITQ.jpeg"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*IPF3hkaPZCjpQtZaPFmITQ.jpeg"/></a></figure><p id="c1a2e848-2f3e-4c0e-9721-197c5c7c812e" class="">Here is the kicker. Being on camera gives you authority <em>even if you aren’t real</em>. This is why pop culture plays such an important role for the Blue Church. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_O%27Connor?source=post_page---------------------------">Carroll O’Connor</a> was somewhat influential as a celebrity. But his character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_the_Family?source=post_page---------------------------">Archie Bunker</a> lives high in the cannon of the Blue Church. Every week for years, millions of people gave their attention to the Archie Bunker family and tuned in to the social signaling of good (and bad) opinion. At a human level, the signaling was very clear. Even as a young child I could read the signs (and monitor the laugh track). Archie was an archetype of a fading good opinion, rapidly moving out of favor; while the rest of the family represented an emerging good opinion in the process of establishing its position in the social field.</p><p id="05757959-4805-4b2a-93a2-deecdce536b1" class="">Yes, we humans can discern between real people and fictional characters. But the importance of pop culture in the operations of the Blue Church shouldn’t be underestimated. Broadcast is powerful. When tens of millions of people are consistently entrained to narratives honed to a sharp edge by market forces to be hyper-capable of grabbing and holding attention, it is going to have an effect. This is particularly true when the entire culture has been trained for generations to learn, think and act within the authority framework of the Church.</p><figure id="e9842ee6-70a5-456d-be30-a46f099a16f0" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aqjV6TWPtqJL8wNXTCstPA.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aqjV6TWPtqJL8wNXTCstPA.jpeg?q=20"/></a></figure><figure id="dbadbc5a-a57c-4a39-9308-cf266d17cc9e" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*aqjV6TWPtqJL8wNXTCstPA.jpeg"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*aqjV6TWPtqJL8wNXTCstPA.jpeg"/></a></figure><h1 id="ec9800dd-1aab-4e97-a85d-a9707c02cac0" class=""><strong>Do as I say, not as I do</strong></h1><p id="31f59360-5347-4d75-94ac-5f140e5acbd0" class="">The contents of popular culture and the good opinion of authorities are important aspects of the Church, but the most central and subtle lesson taught by the Blue Church is the Blue Church itself.</p><p id="e2b6aa4e-fe4f-4249-bf45-438c3624e889" class="">Whether you are learning algebra, or reading about history, or watching a basketball game or listening to your favorite musician, the commonality among all of these is the asymmetric relationship of broadcast. Pay attention, watch and listen closely, learn and express “good opinion” and act accordingly. The content is important, but far more important is the form. The content varies. The form is consistent.</p><p id="cdf1249f-5961-486f-8dca-961bc3c48588" class="">Just like the rowers entrained to the cadence of the coxswain, we have all of us trained for the vast majority of our lives to find, adopt and execute on some kind of master narrative. Some story that is complicated enough to respond to life but simple enough to be managed. Some framework of assumptions, axioms, truths, truth making and authority that takes the absolutely overwhelming complexity of the modern world and allows us poor apes some easy way to move forward in a coordinated fashion.</p><p id="0babd9ba-6bf7-4e44-9e4c-fe446b8a1c22" class="">This fact explains a whole lot about what is going on in America (and most of the West) today. Perhaps it helps explain why the left is always trying to find a narrative to simplify and make the world manageable. It might even explain the mania on the left for psychoanalysis. After all when your principal social responsibility is to respond correctly to authority and deftly read where you are in the field of good opinion, being able to peek behind the psychological curtain is an advantageous skill. (And if you really want to go deep, the ability to dismiss bad opinion as <em>psychopathology</em> is one of the most subtle, and surprisingly common, techniques of the Church.)</p><p id="a44a964e-ca34-4c50-988e-6a2b6c97920f" class="">In any event, the near monopoly of the Church on our ability to make sense and meaning of the world certainly helps to explain why the ongoing <em>collapse</em> of the Blue Church is creating so much anxiety.</p><figure id="bd692a24-31f8-462a-bfcc-633f136e02c5" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*AcWyOemE5Jfpf7hl2V1Xgw.png?q=20"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*AcWyOemE5Jfpf7hl2V1Xgw.png?q=20"/></a></figure><figure id="b916b002-b2a5-405d-b642-93ca318132ce" class="image"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*AcWyOemE5Jfpf7hl2V1Xgw.png"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*AcWyOemE5Jfpf7hl2V1Xgw.png"/></a></figure><h1 id="8372c853-4581-48e8-bedb-2c91ffa2a81f" class=""><strong>The End is Nigh</strong></h1><p id="e439589f-d560-4133-92c7-77ae2c423ed9" class="">There are many reasons why the Blue Church is crumbling. Some of it has to do with an increasing friction among the diverse sub-narratives that have gathered under Blue, particularly where the fundamental incoherence of “identity politics” is reaching a tipping point (and is being <a href="http://takimag.com/article/god_bless_the_right_wing_social_justice_warriors_gavin_mcinnes/print?source=post_page---------------------------#axzz4c9ac2BrG">pushed into what feels to me like a nihilist endgame by the alt-right</a>). However, while this tension is important, I don’t think it is fundamental. Instead, to identify the real existential threat to the Blue Church, I return to our our two core concepts: technology and complexity.</p><p id="89a928f8-fdd2-46da-b32e-00a79a9c0456" class=""><strong>One primary driver behind the collapse of the Blue Church is the swift replacement of the very mass media it is premised upon with a new </strong><strong><em>symmetric</em></strong><strong> kind of media — the Internet. </strong>This new media presents a niche for coherence that is very different from the one that gave rise to the Blue Church. It is a fundamentally different landscape. Like polar bears condemned to extinction by a thawing ice cap, the Blue Church’s days are numbered by the relentless erosion of broadcast mindshare to the new much more symmetrical media of the Internet.</p><p id="b068a2d0-6470-4a01-bb79-4ee2d99c9e22" class="">As I discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/rally-point-journal/situational-assessment-2017-trump-edition-d189d24fc046?source=post_page---------------------------">Situational Assessment: 2017</a>, I assign a significant portion of the surprising victory of the Trump Insurgency to the fact that the transfer of power from broadcast to digital has crossed the tipping point.</p><p id="376ddb66-1ed3-4679-b4cf-5dadd32dae99" class="">It is this technological transition that leads me to the conclusion that while the Blue Church (and its allies in the Deep State and the Establishment) can certainly struggle and hold for a while, their day is done. The climate is changing and they must adapt or die.</p><p id="617dccf6-0510-4054-88b3-dcd9c05fba93" class="">And then there is the question of complexity. The Blue Church emerged in response to the explosion of complexity of the 20th Century and the capacity of mass media to form a control structure that was adequate to that complexity.</p><p id="5b8d566c-a3d5-435f-94ca-d4fe20be8829" class="">It worked. But the 20th Century didn’t stand still. In fact, it accelerated. In the face of this ongoing acceleration, the Blue Church control structure is <em>no longer adequate</em>. The level of complexity of the 21st Century is simply outside of the control capacity that is possible within the form of the Blue Church. Unless we abandon the Church and move to a new approach, our race into the future will be increasingly out of control.</p><p id="08cdfad6-b49c-47b5-b41e-7b6edeedeb02" class="">However, and this is a profoundly important point, we currently know of no form of control structure that is adequate — even in principle.</p><ol id="aa5e2553-87e6-498f-b08a-39de53375284" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Our entire approach to managing complex systems like our environment is flawed.
